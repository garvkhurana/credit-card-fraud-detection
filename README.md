Credit Card Fraud Detection with Logistic Regression Project Overview This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at detecting credit card fraud using logistic regression. By analyzing transaction data, we develop a model capable of distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions with high accuracy. This project not only demonstrates the application of logistic regression in a highly imbalanced dataset but also explores various techniques to handle such data effectively.

Objective The primary goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Through comprehensive data analysis and model tuning, we aim to achieve a balance between recall and precision, ensuring that the model reliably detects fraud while minimizing false positives.

Getting Started Prerequisites Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, imbalanced-learn (for handling imbalanced datasets) Jupyter Notebook or another Python IDE for running the notebook files Installation Clone the repository to get started with the fraud detection project:

bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/garvkhurana/credit-card-fraud-detection.git cd credit-card-fraud-detection Install the required dependencies:

Usage To dive into the fraud detection analysis:

Open the Jupyter Notebook environment: bash Copy code jupyter notebook Navigate and open the Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb notebook. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to follow the data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps. Project Structure data/: Contains the dataset used in the project. Note: due to privacy concerns, the dataset might be a publicly available surrogate. Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the preprocessing steps, model building, training, and evaluation. requirements.txt: Lists all the necessary Python packages.
